Computers have horrible taste in music, but the most cutting edge music is almost exclusively released online and independently.

That's why Burn Cartel made FireFeed. FireFeed is a smart curation system that relies on key Soundcloud
taste makers to find today's most forward thinking and innovative
tracks, ranging from hip-hop, trap, electronic, south-american, to ambient.
With the Eclecto-meterÂ©, you get to choose just how weird and far-ranging things get,
and you could change it up whenever you want! Or, if you find a good groove, keep the playlist going forever :)

Feel free to send any thoughts on the (tech performance) / (music selection) to hola@burncartel.com
